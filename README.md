# John's 1.12.2

This is a CurseForge profile for Minecraft 1.12.2.  
It contains [these mods](./modlist.md), with a focus on simplicity and exploration.

1. Download CurseForge [here](https://www.curseforge.com/download/app).
2. Download the profile [here](https://github.com/jagprog5/modpack-client/releases/latest/download/profile.zip).
3. Import the profile into CurseForge [like shown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPyAjmrpmpU).

# Shaders

This can be skipped if you don't want shaders. OptiFine needs to be downloaded separately.

1. Download OptiFine [here](https://optifine.net/adloadx?f=OptiFine_1.12.2_HD_U_G5.jar).
2. Move it into the profile [like shown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCfDJ7ZFB1c).

MakeUp Ultra Fast shaders are already provided (and are enabled by default).

# Server

This modpack can be played on a server. The server code is [here](https://github.com/jagprog5/modpack-server). It's pretty stable.

### Updating

Do not update the mods, as this will lead to incompatible mod versions with the
server. This repo may be updated and if it is then the server mods will be kept in sync.

## Troubleshooting

If the game starts with a blank screen then delete `options.txt` and restart; this issues was seen on a MacBook.
