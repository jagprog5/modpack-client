# John's 1.12.2

This is a curseforge profile for minecraft 1.12.2. It's compatible with [this server](https://github.com/jagprog5/modpack-server).

It must be zipped before importing into curseforge.

In bash:
```bash
zip -r profile.zip overrides manifest.json
```

Or on windows:

1. ctrl + left click both "overrides" and "manifest.json".
2. right click either of the those, "Sent to", "Compressed (zipped) folder".
3. Use that zip file as the profile.

ComplementaryShaders + Optifine works well with this pack (install separately).

# Updating

Do not update the mods, as this will lead to incompatible mod versions with the
server. This repo may be updated and if it is then the server mods will be kept in sync.
