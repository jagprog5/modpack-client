The use of the chicken chunks mod is for allowing command blocks to run all the time.
There is a chunk far away which is emptied, and that chunk contains command blocks and a spot loader (referred to as the "command chunk").
/tp 100000 100 100000
(remove in y slices)
/fill 100000 100 100000 100015 120 100015 air
(remove any lava or water flow. place a spot loader)

Note that these alternative solutions don't work:
 - Datapacks aren't available in version 1.12.2.
 - With other mods in this pack (I don't know which one), after server start the spawn chunks aren't updated until someone loads them.
Additionally, players can load a couple chunks for farms because it's nice to have.

This intent is reflected in the cfg.
 - The number of chunks which are allowed to be force loaded is limited to 10 per person.
 - Operators' chunks stay loaded forever even if they are not online (needed for the command block chunk);
   in contrast, if non ops go offline then their chunks will unload.
 - For fair play, non ops can't use the chunk viewer.

Here is the cmd block setup to run a mc function every 10 seconds:

(run once manually)
/scoreboard objectives add buf_apply dummy
(repeating, unconditional, always active, facing towards next command block)
/scoreboard players add dummy_player_username buf_timer 1
(chain, unconditional, always active, facing towards next command block)
/scoreboard players test dummy_player_username buf_timer 200 2147483647
(chain, conditional, always active, facing towards next command block)
/scoreboard players set dummy_player_username buf_timer 0
(chain, conditional, always active)
< call the function here >
