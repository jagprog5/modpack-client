Old vanilla minecarts are very bad. For example, [MC-51053](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-51053).  

The intent of including this mod is to fix vanilla behaviour; most of it has been turned off via [modules.cfg](./modules.cfg) and [simplify_railcraft.zs](../../scripts/simplify_railcraft.zs).

Note: to fix a [minor bug](https://github.com/Railcraft/Railcraft/issues/1810) caused by railcraft, TidyChunk is included (see [manifest.json](../../../manifest.json) ID 305460).
