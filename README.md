# Shaders

This can be skipped if you don't want shaders. OptiFine needs to be downloaded separately.

2. Move it into the profile [like shown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCfDJ7ZFB1c).

MakeUp Ultra Fast shaders are already provided.

# Server

This modpack can be played on a server. The server code is [here](https://github.com/jagprog5/modpack-server). It's pretty stable.

### Updating

Do not update the mods, as this will lead to incompatible mod versions with the
server. This repo may be updated and if it is then the server mods will be kept in sync.

## Graphics Issues

If the game starts with a blank screen or otherwise doesn't look right then delete `options.txt` and restart the game. This sets the settings to the default. This issues was seen on a MacBook.
